      <h1> <i>Types of album</i></h1>
      <p>The contents of the album are usually recorded in a studio or live in concert, though may be recorded in <del> "other"</del> "different" locations, such as at home (as with JJ Cale's Okie, Beck's Odelay,David Gray's White Ladder, and others),in the field – as with early Blues recordings,in prison,or with a mobile recording unit such as the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio.</p>
      <h2>Studio</h2>
      <p>"Studio album" redirects here. For the album by Tages, see Studio (album).
      Most albums are studio albums — that is, they are recorded in a recording studio with equipment meant to give those overseeing the recording as much control as possible over the sound of the album. They minimize external noises and reverberations and have highly sensitive microphones and sound mixing equipment. In some studios, each member of a band records their part in separate rooms (or even at separate times, while listening to the other parts of the track with headphones to keep the timing right). In the 2000s, with the advent of digital recording, it became possible for musicians to record their part of a song in another studio in another part of the world, and send their contribution over digital channels to be included in the final product</p>
      <h2>Live</h2>
      <p>Recordings that are done in one take without overdubbing or multi-tracking are termed "live",[46] even when done in a studio.[47] However, the common understanding of a "live album" is one that was recorded at a concert with a public audience,[48] even when the recording is overdubbed or multi-tracked.[49] Concert or stage performances are recorded using remote recording techniques. Albums may be recorded at a single concert, or combine recordings made at multiple concerts. They may include applause, laughter and other noise from the audience, monologues by the performers between pieces, improvisation, and so on. They may use multitrack recording direct from the stage sound system (rather than microphones placed among the audience), and can employ additional manipulation and effects during post-production to enhance the quality of the recording.</p>
      <h2>Solo</h2>
      <p>A solo album, in popular music, is an album recorded by a current or former member of a musical group which is released under that artist's name only, even though some or all other band members may be involved. The solo album appeared as early as the late 1940s. A 1947 Billboard magazine article heralded "Margaret Whiting huddling with Capitol execs over her first solo album on which she will be backed by Frank De Vol".[55] There is no formal definition setting forth the amount of participation a band member can solicit from other members of their band, and still have the album referred to as a solo album. One reviewer wrote that Ringo Starr's third venture, Ringo, "[t]echnically... wasn't a solo album because all four Beatles appeared on it".[56] Three of the four members of the Beatles released solo albums while the group was officially still together.

      A performer may record a solo album for several reasons. A solo performer working with other members will typically have full creative control of the band, be able to hire and fire accompanists, and get the majority of the proceeds.[citation needed] The performer may be able to produce songs that differ widely from the sound of the band with which the performer has been associated, or that the group as a whole chose not to include in its own albums. Graham Nash of the Hollies described his experience in developing a solo album as follows: "The thing that I go through that results in a solo album is an interesting process of collecting songs that can't be done, for whatever reason, by a lot of people".[57] A solo album may also represent the departure of the performer from the group.</p>
      <h2>Compilation album</h2>
      <p>A compilation album is a collection of material from various recording projects or various artists, assembled with a theme such as the "greatest hits" from one artist, B-sides and rarities by one artist, or selections from a record label, a musical genre, a certain time period, or a regional music scene. Promotional sampler albums are compilations.</p>
      <h2>Tribute or cover</h2>
      <p>A tribute or cover album is a compilation of cover versions of songs or instrumental compositions. Its concept may involve various artists covering the songs of a single artist, genre or period, a single artist covering the songs of various artists or a single artist, genre or period, or any variation of an album of cover songs which is marketed as a "tribute".</p>
